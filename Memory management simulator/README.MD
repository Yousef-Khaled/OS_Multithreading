A Memory management simulator that allows for :

- Memory Allocation using three methods 
	1-Best fit
	2- Worst fit
	3- First fit

- Memory Deallocation

- Defragmentation using three methods 
	1- split a partition into two partitions (eliminating internal fragmentation) 
	2- Grouping contiguous free blocks (eliminating external fragmentation)
	3- Grouping non-contiguous free blocks (eliminating external fragmentation)
